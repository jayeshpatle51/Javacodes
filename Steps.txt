* first I will take all the columns in seperate list by column name.
*then i will create one another list.
*i will copy change column list to that new list name sortedlist.
*Then i will sort that list.
*Then i will reverse that list.
*Then i will create one for loop and again create second for loop
in first for loop.
*create one condition boolean equal to false.
*then int index =0.
*Then using if condition if sortedlist.get(i)==list1.get(i)
then i will make index is equals j.
condition true.
break.
*if condition true
then i will print (sortedlist.get(i)+list2.get(index)+list3.get(index));
